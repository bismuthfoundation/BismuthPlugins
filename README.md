## Need for plugin

Since Bismuth is entirely written in Python, it's easy to tweak, add features and test without compilation step.  
However this makes upgrades harder since the core code has to be modified and then edits have to be carefully merged.

The Bismuth plugin system, although very lightweight, allows for action and filter hooks on critical events, for easy feature addition.
